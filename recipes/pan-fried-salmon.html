    <h2>Description</h2>
    Salmon is one of the healthiest meats in the market. This delicious dish will not only fill up your macro sheet but also your stomach.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5-ounce) center-cut salmon fillets (about 1-inch-thick), skin on or off</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the salmon to room temperature 10 minutes before cooking.</li>
        <li>Warm a large nonstick skillet with oil over medium-low heat. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Raise the heat to medium-high. Place the salmon, skin-side up in the pan. Cook until golden brown on 1 side, about 4 minutes. Turn the fish over with a spatula, and cook until it feels firm to the touch and the skin is crisp if desired, about 3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>The skin can be served or removed easily with a knife or spoon.</li>
    </ol>
